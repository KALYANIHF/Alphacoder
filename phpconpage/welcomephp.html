    <h1>Welcome to PHP</h1>

    <h1>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (earlier called, Personal Home Page)</h1>
    <p>
      PHP is an HTML-embedded, server-side scripting language designed for web
      development. It is also used as a general purpose programming language. It
      was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and appeared in the market in 1995.
      Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, C++, and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHP codes are simply mixed with HTML codes and can be used in combination
      with various web frameworks. Its scripts are executed on the server. PHP
      code is processed by a PHP interpreter. The main goal of PHP is to allow
      web developer to create dynamically generated pages quickly.A PHP file
      consists of texts, HTML tags and scripts with a file extension of .php,
      .php3, or .phtml. You can create a login page, design a form, create
      forums, dynamic and static websites and many more with PHP.

      PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common
      Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in which he used to maintain his personal
      homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with
      databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms
      Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To
      accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced
      the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version
      1.0" on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on
      June 8, 1995. This release already had the basic functionality that PHP
      has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the
      ability to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was simpler,
      more limited and less consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew
      organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don't know how to stop
      it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I
      have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept
      adding the next logical step on the way."[21] A development team began to
      form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released
      PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed
      organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent
      ordering of their parameters.[22] In some cases, the function names were
      chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was "wrapping",[23]
      while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names
      was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve
      the distribution of hash values.
