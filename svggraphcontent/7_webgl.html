    <h1>WebGL(Web Graphics Library)</h1>
    <p>
      WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D
      and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of
      plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to
      OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 &lt;canvas> elements. This
      conformance makes it possible for the API to take advantage of hardware
      graphics acceleration provided by the user's device. Support for WebGL is
      present in Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 9+, Opera 12+, Safari 5.1+, Internet
      Explorer 11+, and Microsoft Edge build 10240+; however, the user's device
      must also have hardware that supports these features. The WebGL 2 API
      introduces support for much of the OpenGL ES 3.0 feature set; it's
      provided through the WebGL2RenderingContext interface. The &lt;canvas>
      element is also used by the Canvas API to do 2D graphics on web pages.
    </p>
    <h3>Before you start</h3>
    <p>
      Using the &lt;canvas> element is not very difficult, but you do need a
      basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript. The &lt;canvas> element and
      WebGL are not supported in some older browsers, but are supported in
      recent versions of all major browsers. In order to draw graphics on the
      canvas we use a JavaScript context object, which creates graphics on the
      fly
    </p>
    <h4>How to set up a WebGL context?</h4>
    <p>
      WebGL enables web content to use an API based on OpenGL ES 2.0 to perform
      2D and 3D rendering in an HTML canvas in browsers that support it without
      the use of plug-ins. WebGL programs consist of control code written in
      JavaScript and shader code (GLSL) that is executed on a computer's
      Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL elements can be mixed with other
      HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page
      background. This article will introduce you to the basics of using WebGL.
      It's assumed that you already have an understanding of the mathematics
      involved in 3D graphics, and this article doesn't pretend to try to teach
      you 3D graphics concepts itself. The code examples in this tutorial can
      also be found in the webgl-examples GitHub repository. It's worth noting
      here that this series of articles introduces WebGL itself; however, there
      are a number of frameworks available that encapsulate WebGL's
      capabilities, making it easier to build 3D applications and games, such as
      THREE.js.
    </p>
    <h2>Preparing to render in 3D</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing you need in order to use WebGL for rendering is a canvas.
      The HTML fragment below declares a canvas that our sample will draw into.
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
        &lt;body>
        &lt;canvas id="glCanvas" width="640" height="480">&lt;canvas>
      &lt;/body>
    </pre
      >
    </div>
    <h2>Preparing the WebGL context</h2>
    <p>
      The main() function in our JavaScript code, is called when our script is
      loaded. Its purpose is to set up the WebGL context and start rendering
      content.
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
      //
      // start here
      //
      function main() {
      const canvas = document.querySelector("#glCanvas");
      // Initialize the GL context
      const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl");
      
      // Only continue if WebGL is available and working
      if (gl === null) {
      alert("Unable to initialize WebGL. Your browser or machine may not support it.");
      return;
      }
      
      // Set clear color to black, fully opaque
      gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
      // Clear the color buffer with specified clear color
      gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
      }
      
      window.onload = main;</pre
      >
    </div>
    <p>
      The first thing we do here is obtain a reference to the canvas, assigning
      it to a variable named canvas. Once we have the canvas, we try to get a
      WebGLRenderingContext for it by calling getContext and passing it the
      string "webgl". If the browser does not support webgl getContext will
      return null in which case we will display a message to the user and exit.
      If the context is successfully initialized, the variable gl is our
      reference to it. In this case, we set the clear color to black, and clear
      the context to that color (redrawing the canvas with the background
      color). At this point, you have enough code that the WebGL context should
      successfully initialize, and you should wind up with a big black, empty
      box, ready and waiting to receive content.
