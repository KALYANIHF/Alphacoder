    <h1>Welcome to HTML Tutorials</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>"HTML" full form: <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b></h2>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
      Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
      technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
      appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either
      within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental
      aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
      pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the
      World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display
      in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as<b>
        &lt;head>, &lt;title>,&lt;body>, &lt;header>, &lt;footer>, &lt;article>,
        &lt;section>, &lt;p>, &lt;div>, &lt;span>, &lt;img>, &lt;aside>,
        &lt;audio>, &lt;canvas>, &lt;datalist>&lt;details>, &lt;embed>,
        &lt;nav>, &lt;output>, &lt;progress>, &lt;video>, &lt;ul>, &lt;ol>,
        &lt;li> </b
      >and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which
      consist of the element name surrounded by "&lt;" and ">" . The name of an
      element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in
      uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title> tag can be
      written as &lt;Title>, &lt;TITLE>, or in any other way.

      In 1980, physicist <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a contractor at CERN, proposed
      and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from
      1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put
      an encyclopedia first. The first publicly available description of HTML
      was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim
      Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
      relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were
      strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup
      Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
      elements still exist in HTML 4.HTML is a markup language that web browsers
      use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual
      or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML
      markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be
      altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many
      of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
      Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text
      formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in
      the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating
      system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
      typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of
      generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with
      attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of
      structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction
      with CSS. Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was
      formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
      specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by
      Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type
      definition to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but
      was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag
      for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing
      standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing
      Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
      suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and
      fill-out forms. After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the
      IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0",
      the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against
      which future implementations should be based. Further development under
      the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996,
      the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
      software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, in
      2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000).
      HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published
      through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext
      Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint
      deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28
      October 2014.
