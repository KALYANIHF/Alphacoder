    <h1>3D Computer Graphics</h1>
    <p>
      In the 2D system, we use only two coordinates X and Y but in 3D, an extra
      coordinate Z is added. 3D graphics techniques and their application are
      fundamental to the entertainment, games, and computer-aided design
      industries. It is a continuing area of research in scientific
      visualization. Furthermore, 3D graphics components are now a part of
      almost every personal computer and, although traditionally intended for
      graphics-intensive software such as games, they are increasingly being
      used by other applications.

    <h2>Parallel Projection</h2>
    <p>
      Parallel projection discards z-coordinate and parallel lines from each
      vertex on the object are extended until they intersect the view plane. In
      parallel projection, we specify a direction of projection instead of
      center of projection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel projection, the distance from the center of projection to
      project plane is infinite. In this type of projection, we connect the
      projected vertices by line segments which correspond to connections on the
      original object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parallel projections are less realistic, but they are good for exact
      measurements. In this type of projections, parallel lines remain parallel
      and angles are not preserved. Various types of parallel projections are
      shown in the following hierarchy.
    </p>

    <h3>Orthographic Projection</h3>
    <p>
      In orthographic projection the direction of projection is normal to the
      projection of the plane. There are three types of orthographic projections
      −
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Front Projection</li>
      <li>Top Projection</li>
      <li>Side Projection</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images_svg/img4.PNG" alt="" />
    <h2>Oblique Projection</h2>
    <p>
      In oblique projection, the direction of projection is not normal to the
      projection of plane. In oblique projection, we can view the object better
      than orthographic projection.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of oblique projections − Cavalier and Cabinet. The
      Cavalier projection makes 45° angle with the projection plane. The
      projection of a line perpendicular to the view plane has the same length
      as the line itself in Cavalier projection. In a cavalier projection, the
      foreshortening factors for all three principal directions are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cabinet projection makes 63.4° angle with the projection plane. In
      Cabinet projection, lines perpendicular to the viewing surface are
      projected at ½ their actual length. Both the projections are shown in the
      following figure −
    </p>

    <h2>Perspective Projection</h2>
    <p>
      In perspective projection, the distance from the center of projection to
      project plane is finite and the size of the object varies inversely with
      distance which looks more realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance and angles are not preserved and parallel lines do not remain
      parallel. Instead, they all converge at a single point called center of
      projection or projection reference point. There are 3 types of perspective
      projections which are shown in the following chart.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One point perspective projection is simple to draw.</li>
      <li>
        Two point perspective projection gives better impression of depth.
      </li>
      <li>Three point perspective projection is most difficult to draw.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Translation</h2>
    <p>
      In 3D translation, we transfer the Z coordinate along with the X and Y
      coordinates. The process for translation in 3D is similar to 2D
      translation. A translation moves an object into a different position on
      the screen. The following figure shows the effect of translation −
