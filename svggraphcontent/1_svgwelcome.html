    <h1>Graphic Design Basics</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Perception</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cartographers and design both use visual inter- human communication. In
      order to discuss graphic design, we have to deal with the topic of the
      communicating human. But to understand the communication process, first of
      all we have to speak about human perception.
    </p>
    <h2>Outer and Inner Worlds</h2>
    <p>
      What and how do people perceive?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, primarily people perceive their environ- ment - the outer world.
      They see, hear, touch, smell and taste it. For that purpose they have
      perceptual organs. During the perception proc- ess all senses work
      simultaneously and therefore it is not easy to decide which sense is
      decisive for the occurrence of a reaction in a certain situ- ation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take supper for example: Is the tasting sense dominating, because the meal
      is tasting deli- ciously, or the eye, because the table is nicely laid
      out, or the ear, because the conversation and the music are pleasing?
      Humans also per- manently experience themselves, their inner world. The
      limbs and organs call our attention if they are exhausted or diseased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soul, the psyche plays an important role deciding on the state of
      well-being. Humans feel, they perceive moods and instincts and know
      whether they are walking or sitting or doing something.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perception overload</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Peopleâ€™s inner and outer worlds impact upon them simultaneously and are
      perceived in con- junction. the perception process is a permanent state
      during every situation of life, impossible to switch off. It is impossible
      also for people to fil- ter out a specific perception, as in addition to
      that they have to survey its environment; like- wise they cannot switch
      off one particular sense. They can only try to concentrate on some specif-
      ic aspect.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Selection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The biggest part of all incoming stimuli is per- ceived subconsciously and
      this part decisively shapes us. To shield from a stimuli overflow peo- ple
      can try to perceive part of all information consciously, just big enough
      to be digested sep- arately (selection). The perception process pro- ceeds
      as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First of all people are confronted with a disor- dered general
        impression.
      </li>
      <li>Consecutively they select specific information (selection).</li>
      <li>
        They try to order them by looking at them con- sciously (synthesis).
      </li>
      <li>
        But simultaneously they discover new stimuli and try to integrate them
        in their system as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally they receive an ordered whole, an over- view. While analysing it
        a feedback process is initiated influenced by many components.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="./images_svg/img1.PNG" alt="" />
    <p>
      The term graphic design was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922.
      However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of
      human existence, from the caves of Lascaux, to Rome's Trajan's Column to
      the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of
      Ginza, Tokyo. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions
    </p>
    <p>
      into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks
      gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or
      some other dignitary". This was the first known road sign announcing the
      name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians
      developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating
      as far back as 136 B.C. found on the Rosetta Stone. "The Rosetta stone,
      found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian
      ruler, Ptolemy as the "true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and
      the Keeper of the Happiness of Men"" The Egyptians also invented papyrus,
      paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed
      advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the
      "Dark Ages", from 500 AD to 1450 AD, monks created elaborate, illustrated
      manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of
      visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction
      between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared.
      They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and
      sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate
      objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the
      essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and
      feeling to artifacts that document human experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphic design in the United States began with Benjamin Franklin who used
      his newspaper The Pennsylvania Gazette, to master the art of publicity to
      promote his own books and to influence the masses. "Benjamin Franklin's
      ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had
      replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, Andrew Bradford as postmaster
      and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his
      prowess by running an ad in his General Magazine and the Historical
      Chronicle of British Plantations in America (the precursor to the Saturday
      Evening Post) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented,
      named the Pennsylvania Fireplace. His invention is still sold today and is
      known as the Franklin stove. "
    </p>
    <p>
      American advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines.
      Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made
      it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point
      type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and
      centered it, making "headlines". Franklin added illustrations, something
      that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize
      logos, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians
      by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use
      of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements
      ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the
      goods that were offered.[citation needed]
