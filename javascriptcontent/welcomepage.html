    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time
      compiled, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
      essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,
      and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
      functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based)
      programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates,
      regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include
      any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies
      upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines
      are now embedded in many other types of host software, including
      server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as
      word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make
      JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications,
      including desktop widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not
      extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in
      Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including
      language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
      languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript was
      influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[15] The JSON
      serialization format, used to store data structures in files or transmit
      them across networks, is based on JavaScript.[16
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="../img/Brendan_Eich.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="" />
      In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a
      unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA
      Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important
      part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the
      NeXTSTEP niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In
      1994, a company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View,
      California and employed many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create
      Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA
      Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, a
      portmanteau of "Mosaic and Godzilla". The first version of the Web
      browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four
      months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and
      became the main web browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership
      problems with the NCSA, the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape
      Navigator in the same year, and the company took the name Netscape
      Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to
      become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the founder of the company, believed
      that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web designers
      and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and
      plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of
      embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.[18]
      Before he could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun
      Microsystems to include Sun's more static programming language, Java, in
      Netscape Navigator so as to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of
      Web technologies and platforms. Netscape Communications then decided that
      the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and
      should have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such
      as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against
      competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10
      days, in May 1995.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was
      officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of
      Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript
      when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December. The
      final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the
      language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice
      has been characterized[21] as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give
      JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an
      earlier Web page scripting language developed by Nombas named Cmm (not to
      be confused with the later C-- created in 1997). Brendan Eich, however,
      had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript. Nombas did pitch
      their embedded Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting
      was not a new concept, as shown by the ViolaWWW Web browser. Nombas later
      switched to offering JavaScript instead of Cmm in their ScriptEase product
      and was part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.
