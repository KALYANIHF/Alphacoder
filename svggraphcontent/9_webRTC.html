    <h1>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)</h1>
    <p>
      WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology which enables Web
      applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video
      media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without
      requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes
      it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer,
      without requiring that the user installs plug-ins or any other third-party
      software. WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which
      work together to achieve this. The documentation you'll find here will
      help you understand the fundamentals of WebRTC, how to set up and use both
      data and media connections, and more.
    </p>
    <h2>Interoperability</h2>
    <p>
      Because implementations of WebRTC are still evolving, and because each
      browser has different levels of support for codecs and WebRTC features,
      you should strongly consider making use of the Adapter.js library provided
      by Google before you begin to write your code. Adapter.js uses shims and
      polyfills to smooth over the differences among the WebRTC implementations
      across the environments supporting it. Adapter.js also handles prefixes
      and other naming differences to make the entire WebRTC development process
      easier, with more broadly compatible results. The library is also
      available as an NPM package.
    </p>
    <h2>WebRTC concepts and usage</h2>
    <p>
      WebRTC serves multiple purposes; together with the Media Capture and
      Streams API, they provide powerful multimedia capabilities to the Web,
      including support for audio and video conferencing, file exchange, screen
      sharing, identity management, and interfacing with legacy telephone
      systems including support for sending DTMF (touch-tone dialing) signals.
      Connections between peers can be made without requiring any special
      drivers or plug-ins, and can often be made without any intermediary
      servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      and opened using RTCPeerConnection, media streams (MediaStreams) and/or
      data channels (RTCDataChannels) can be added to the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Media streams can consist of any number of tracks of media information;
      tracks, which are represented by objects based on the MediaStreamTrack
      interface, may contain one of a number of types of media data, including
      audio, video, and text (such as subtitles or even chapter names). Most
      streams consist of at least one audio track and likely also a video track,
      and can be used to send and receive both live media or stored media
      information (such as a streamed movie).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the connection between two peers to exchange arbitrary
      binary data using the RTCDataChannel interface. This can be used for
      back-channel information, metadata exchange, game status packets, file
      transfers, or even as a primary channel for data transfer.
    </p>
    <h2>WebRTC interfaces</h2>
    <p>
      Because WebRTC provides interfaces that work together to accomplish a
      variety of tasks, we have divided up the interfaces in the list below by
      category. Please see the sidebar for an alphabetical list.
    </p>
    <h3>Connection setup and management</h3>
    <p>
      These interfaces are used to set up, open, and manage WebRTC connections.
      Included are interfaces representing peer media connections, data
      channels, and interfaces used when exchanging information on the
      capabilities of each peer in order to select the best possible
      configuration for a two-way media connection..
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RTCPeerConnection</b>
      Represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote
      peer. It is used to handle efficient streaming of data between the two
      peers.
      <b>RTCDataChannel</b>
      Represents a bi-directional data channel between two peers of a
      connection. RTCDataChannelEvent Represents events that occur while
      attaching a RTCDataChannel to a RTCPeerConnection. The only event sent
      with this interface is datachannel.
      <b>RTCSessionDescription</b>
      Represents the parameters of a session. Each RTCSessionDescription
      consists of a description type indicating which part of the offer/answer
      negotiation process it describes and of the SDP descriptor of the session.
      RTCSessionDescriptionCallback The RTCSessionDescriptionCallback is passed
      into the RTCPeerConnection object when requesting it to create offers or
      answers.
      <b>RTCStatsReport</b>
      Provides information detailing statistics for a connection or for an
      individual track on the connection; the report can be obtained by calling
      RTCPeerConnection.getStats(). Details about using WebRTC statistics can be
      found in WebRTC Statistics API.
      <b>RTCIceCandidate</b>
      Represents a candidate Internet Connectivity Establishment (ICE) server
      for establishing an RTCPeerConnection.
      <b>RTCIceTransport</b>
      Represents information about an ICE transport.
      <b>RTCIceServer</b>
      Defines how to connect to a single ICE server (such as a STUN or TURN
      server).
      <b>RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent</b>
      Represents events that occur in relation to ICE candidates with the
      target, usually an RTCPeerConnection. Only one event is of this type:
      icecandidate.
      <b>RTCRtpSender</b>
      Manages the encoding and transmission of data for a MediaStreamTrack on an
      RTCPeerConnection.
      <b>RTCRtpReceiver</b>
      Manages the reception and decoding of data for a MediaStreamTrack on an
      RTCPeerConnection.
      <b>RTCRtpContributingSource</b>
      Contains information about a given contributing source (CSRC) including
      the most recent time a packet that the source contributed was played out.
      <b>RTCTrackEvent</b>
      The interface used to represent a track event, which indicates that an
      RTCRtpReceiver object was added to the RTCPeerConnection object,
      indicating that a new incoming MediaStreamTrack was created and added to
      the RTCPeerConnection.
      <b>RTCConfiguration</b>
      Used to provide configuration options for an RTCPeerConnection.
      <b>RTCSctpTransport</b>
      Provides information which describes a Stream Control Transmission
      Protocol (SCTP) transport and also provides a way to access the underlying
      Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) transport over which SCTP packets
      for all of an RTCPeerConnection's data channels are sent and received.
      <b>RTCSctpTransportState</b>
      Indicates the state of an RTCSctpTransport instance.
