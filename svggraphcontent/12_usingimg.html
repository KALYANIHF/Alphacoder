    <h1>Using Image in Graphics</h1>
    <p>
      An image consists of a rectangular array of dots called pixels. The size
      of the image is specified in terms of width X height, in numbers of the
      pixels. The physical size of the image, in inches or centimeters, depends
      on the resolution of the device on which the image is displayed. The
      resolution is usually measured in DPI (Dots Per Inch). An image will
      appear smaller on a device with a higher resolution than on one with a
      lower resolution. For color images, one needs enough bits per pixel to
      represent all the colors in the image. The number of the bits per pixel is
      called the depth of the image.
    </p>
    <h2>Image data types</h2>
    <p>
      Images can be created by using different techniques of representation of
      data called data type like monochrome and colored images. Monochrome image
      is created by using single color whereas colored image is created by using
      multiple colors. Some important data types of images are following:
    </p>
    <dl><h3>1-bit images-</h3></dl>
    <dt>
      An image is a set of pixels. Note that a pixel is a picture element in
      digital image. In 1-bit images, each pixel is stored as a single bit (0 or
      1). A bit has only two states either on or off, white or black, true or
      false. Therefore, such an image is also referred to as a binary image,
      since only two states are available. 1-bit image is also known as 1-bit
      monochrome images because it contains one color that is black for off
      state and white for on state. A 1-bit image with resolution 640*480 needs
      a storage space of 640*480 bits. 640 x 480 bits. = (640 x 480) / 8 bytes =
      (640 x 480) / (8 x 1024) KB= 37.5KB. The clarity or quality of 1-bit image
      is very low.
    </dt>
    <dl><h3>8-bit Gray level images-</h3></dl>
    <dt>
      Each pixel of 8-bit gray level image is represented by a single byte (8
      bits). Therefore each pixel of such image can hold 28=256 values between 0
      and 255. Therefore each pixel has a brightness value on a scale from black
      (0 for no brightness or intensity) to white (255 for full brightness or
      intensity). For example, a dark pixel might have a value of 15 and a
      bright one might be 240.
      <br />
      A grayscale digital image is an image in which the value of each pixel is
      a single sample, which carries intensity information. Images are composed
      exclusively of gray shades, which vary from black being at the weakest
      intensity to white being at the strongest. Grayscale images carry many
      shades of gray from black to white. Grayscale images are also called
      monochromatic, denoting the presence of only one (mono) color (chrome). An
      image is represented by bitmap. A bitmap is a simple matrix of the tiny
      dots (pixels) that form an image and are displayed on a computer screen or
      printed.
      <br />
      A 8-bit image with resolution 640 x 480 needs a storage space of 640 x 480
      bytes=(640 x 480)/1024 KB= 300KB. Therefore an 8-bit image needs 8 times
      more storage space than 1-bit image.
    </dt>
    <dl><h3>24-bit color images -</h3></dl>
    <dt>
      In 24-bit color image, each pixel is represented by three bytes, usually
      representing RGB (Red, Green and Blue). Usually true color is defined to
      mean 256 shades of RGB (Red, Green and Blue) for a total of 16777216 color
      variations. It provides a method of representing and storing graphical
      image information an RGB color space such that a colors, shades and hues
      in large number of variations can be displayed in an image such as in high
      quality photo graphic images or complex graphics.
      <br />
      Many 24-bit color images are stored as 32-bit images, and an extra byte
      for each pixel used to store an alpha value representing special effect
      information. A 24-bit color image with resolution 640 x 480 needs a
      storage space of 640 x 480 x 3 bytes = (640 x 480 x 3) / 1024=900KB
      without any compression. Also 32-bit color image with resolution 640 x 480
      needs a storage space of 640 x 480 x 4 bytes= 1200KB without any
      compression.
    </dt>
    <dl><h3>8-bit color images -</h3></dl>
    <dt>
      8-bit color graphics is a method of storing image information in a
      computer's memory or in an image file, where one byte (8 bits) represents
      each pixel. The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at once is
      256. 8-bit color graphics are of two forms. The first form is where the
      image stores not color but an 8-bit index into the color map for each
      pixel, instead of storing the full 24-bit color value. Therefore, 8-bit
      image formats consists of two parts: a color map describing what colors
      are present in the image and the array of index values for each pixel in
      the image. In most color maps each color is usually chosen from a palette
      of 16,777,216 colors (24 bits: 8 red, 8green, 8 blue).
      <br />
      The other form is where the 8-bits use 3 bits for red, 3 bits for green
      and 2 bits for blue. This second form is often called 8-bit true color as
      it does not use a palette at all. When a 24-bit full color image is turned
      into an 8-bit image, some of the colors have to be eliminated, known as
      color quantization process.
      <br />
      A 8-bit color image with resolution 640 x 480 needs a storage space of 640
      x 480 bytes=(640 x 480) / 1024KB= 300KB without any compression.
    </dt>
    <h3>Color lookup tables</h3>
    <p>
      A color loop-up table (LUT) is a mechanism used to transform a range of
      input colors into another range of colors. Color look-up table will
      convert the logical color numbers stored in each pixel of video memory
      into physical colors, represented as RGB triplets, which can be displayed
      on a computer monitor. Each pixel of image stores only index value or
      logical color number. For example if a pixel stores the value 30, the
      meaning is to go to row 30 in a color look-up table (LUT). The LUT is
      often called a Palette.
    </p>
    <h2>Characteristic of LUT are following:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The number of entries in the palette determines the maximum number of
        colors which can appear on screen simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        The width of each entry in the palette determines the number of colors
        which the wider full palette can represent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A common example would be a palette of 256 colors that is the number of
      entries is 256 and thus each entry is addressed by an 8-bit pixel value.
      Each color can be chosen from a full palette, with a total of 16.7 million
      colors that is the each entry is of 24 bits and 8 bits per channel which
      sets the total combinations of 256 levels for each of the red, green and
      blue components 256 x 256 x 256 =16,777,216 colors

    <h3>Getting images to draw</h3>
    <p>
      The canvas API is able to use any of the following data types as an image
      source
    </p>
    <h3><dl>HTMLImageElement</dl></h3>
    <dt>
      These are images created using the Image() constructor, as well as any
      &lt;img /> element.
    </dt>
    <h3><dl>SVGImageElement</dl></h3>
    <dt>These are images embedded using the &lt;image> element.</dt>
    <h3><dl>HTMLVideoElement</dl></h3>
    <dt>
      Using an HTML &lt;video> element as your image source grabs the current
      frame from the video and uses it as an image.
    </dt>
    <h3><dl>HTMLCanvasElement</dl></h3>
    <dt>
      You can use another &lt;canvas> element as your image source. These
      sources are collectively referred to by the type CanvasImageSource. There
      are several ways to get images for use on a canvas.
    </dt>
    <h3>Using images from the same page</h3>
    <p>
      We can obtain a reference to images on the same page as the canvas by
      using one of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The document.images collection</li>
      <li>The document.getElementsByTagName() method</li>
      <li>
        If you know the ID of the specific image you wish to use, you can use
        document.getElementById() to retrieve that specific image
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using images from other domains</h3>
    <p>
      Using the crossorigin attribute of an <img /> element (reflected by the
      HTMLImageElement.crossOrigin property), you can request permission to load
      an image from another domain for use in your call to drawImage(). If the
      hosting domain permits cross-domain access to the image, the image can be
      used in your canvas without tainting it; otherwise using the image will
      taint the canvas.
