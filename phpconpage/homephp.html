      PHP is very popular language because of its simplicity and open source.
      There are some important features of PHP given below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Performance:</b> PHP script is executed much faster than those
        scripts which are written in other languages such as JSP and ASP. PHP
        uses its own memory, so the server workload and loading time is
        automatically reduced, which results in faster processing speed and
        better performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Open Source:</b> PHP source code and software are freely available on
        the web. You can develop all the versions of PHP according to your
        requirement without paying any cost. All its components are free to
        download and use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Familiarity with syntax:</b> PHP has easily understandable syntax.
        Programmers are comfortable coding with it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Embedded:</b> PHP code can be easily embedded within HTML tags and
        script.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Platform Independent:</b> PHP is available for WINDOWS, MAC, LINUX &
        UNIX operating system. A PHP application developed in one OS can be
        easily executed in other OS also.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Database Support:</b> PHP supports all the leading databases such as
        MySQL, SQLite, ODBC, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Error Reporting -</b> PHP has predefined error reporting constants to
        generate an error notice or warning at runtime. E.g., E_ERROR,
        E_WARNING, E_STRICT, E_PARSE.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Loosely Typed Language:</b> PHP allows us to use a variable without
        declaring its datatype. It will be taken automatically at the time of
        execution based on the type of data it contains on its value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Web servers Support:</b> PHP is compatible with almost all local
        servers used today like Apache, Netscape, Microsoft IIS, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security:</b> PHP is a secure language to develop the website. It
        consists of multiple layers of security to prevent threads and malicious
        attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Control:</b> Different programming languages require long script or
        code, whereas PHP can do the same work in a few lines of code. It has
        maximum control over the websites like you can make changes easily
        whenever you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>A Helpful PHP Community:</b> It has a large community of developers
        who regularly updates documentation, tutorials, online help, and FAQs.
        Learning PHP from the communities is one of the significant benefits.
      </li>
    </ul>
