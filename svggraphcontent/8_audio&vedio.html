    <h1>Audio and Vedio</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we are comfortable with adding simple images to a webpage, the
      next step is to start adding video and audio players to your HTML
      documents! In this article we'll look at doing just that with the
      &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements; we'll then finish off by looking at
      how to add captions/subtitles to your videos.
    </p>
    <h2>Video and audio on the web</h2>
    <p>
      Web developers have wanted to use video and audio on the Web for a long
      time, ever since the early 2000s, when we started to have bandwidth fast
      enough to support any kind of video (video files are much larger than text
      or even images.) In the early days, native web technologies such as HTML
      didn't have the ability to embed video and audio on the Web, so
      proprietary (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash (and later,
      Silverlight) became popular for handling such content. This kind of
      technology worked ok, but it had a number of problems, including not
      working well with HTML/CSS features, security issues, and accessibility
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      A native solution would solve much of this if implemented correctly.
      Fortunately, a few years later the HTML5 specification had such features
      added, with the &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements, and some shiny new
      JavaScript APIs for controlling them. We'll not be looking at JavaScript
      here — just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      We won't be teaching you how to produce audio and video files — that
      requires a completely different skillset. We have provided you with sample
      audio and video files and example code for your own experimentation, in
      case you are unable to get hold of your own.
    </p>
    <h3>The &lt;video> element</h3>
    <p>
      The &lt;video> element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really
      simple example looks like this:
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
        <video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
      </video>
    </pre>
    </div>
    <pre>
      The features of note are:
      
      src
      In the same way as for the &lt;img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It
      works in exactly the same way.
      controls
      Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must
      either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the
      appropriate JavaScript API. At minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the
      volume.
      The paragraph inside the &lt;video> tags
        This is called fallback content — this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the &lt;video>
          element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've
          provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser
          they are using.
          The embedded video will look something like this:

    </pre>
    <a href="7_webgl.html"><button type="button" id="left">PREV</button></a>
    <a href="9_webRTC.html"><button type="button" id="right">NEXT</button></a>
