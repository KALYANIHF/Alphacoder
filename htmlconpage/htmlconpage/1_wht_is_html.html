    <h1>What is HTML</h1>
   <p>
    HTML is an acronym which stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> which is used for creating web pages and web
    applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.<br/><br/>
    <b>Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click
    on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web
    pages (HTML documents) with each other.<br/><br/>
   <b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a
    text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links,
    etc.<br/><br/>
    <b>Web Page:</b> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be
    identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. <b>With the help of HTML only, we can
    create static web pages.</b><br/><br/>
    
    Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which
    looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different
    content.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Let's see a simple example of HTML.</b>

  <h1>Brief History of HTML</h1>
  <p>In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers.
  In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system. <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
  Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.</p>
  <h1>HTML Versions</h1>
  <p>Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the HTML
  version is given below: <br><br>
  
  <b>HTML 1.0:</b> The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was released
  in1991. <br><br>
  
  <b>HTML 2.0:</b> This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website design.
  HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option
  button, etc. <br><br>
  
  <b>HTML 3.2:</b> HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and providing
  support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It
  became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the
  browsers. <br/><br/>
  
  <b>HTML 4.01:</b> HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language. This
  version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for
  various multimedia elements. <br/><br/>
  
  <b>HTML5 :</b> HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced in
  January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another one is WHATWG( Web
  Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML 5 version, and still, it
  is under development.

<h1>Features of HTML</h1>
<p>
 <ol>
   <li>It is a very <b>easy and simple language.</b> It can be easily understood and modified.</li><br>
   <li>It is very easy to make an <b>effective presentation</b> with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.</li><br>
   <li>It is a <b>markup language,</b> so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.
</li><br>
   <li>It facilitates programmers to add a <b>link</b> on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing
  of the user.</li><br>
   <li>It is <b>platform-independent</b> because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.</li><br>
   <li>It facilitates the programmer to add <b>Graphics, Videos,</b> and <b>Sound</b> to the web pages which makes it more attractive and
  interactive.</li><br>
   <li>HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.</li><br>
 </ol>
