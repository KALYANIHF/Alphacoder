    <h1>2D GRAPHICS</h1>
    <p>
      2D computer graphics is the computer-based generation of digital
      images—mostly from two-dimensional models (such as 2D geometric models,
      text, and digital images) and by techniques specific to them. The word may
      stand for the branch of computer science that comprises such techniques or
      for the models themselves.
    </p>
    <h2>2D graphics techniques</h2>
    <p>
      2D graphics models may combine geometric models (also called vector
      graphics), digital images (also called raster graphics), text to be
      typeset (defined by content, font style and size, color, position, and
      orientation), mathematical functions and equations, and more. These
      components can be modified and manipulated by two-dimensional geometric
      transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In object oriented graphics, the image is described indirectly by an
      object endowed with a self-rendering method—a procedure which assigns
      colors to the image pixels by an arbitrary algorithm. Complex models can
      be built by combining simpler objects, in the paradigms of object-oriented
      programming.
    </p>
    <h2>Direct painting</h2>
    <p>
      A convenient way to create a complex image is to start with a blank
      canvas—a raster map (array of pixels — also known as a bitmap (or pixmap
      if it is in colour)) filled with some uniform background color—and then
      "draw", "paint" or "paste" simple patches of color onto it, in an
      appropriate order. In particular, the canvas may be the frame buffer for a
      computer display. Some programs will set the pixel colors directly, but
      most will rely on some 2D graphics library and/or the machine's graphics
      card, which usually implement the following operations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>paste a given image at a specified offset onto the canvas;</li>
      <li>
        write a string of characters with a specified font, at a given position
        and angle;
      </li>
      <li>
        paint a simple geometric shape, such as a triangle defined by three
        corners, or a circle with given center and radius;
      </li>
      <li>
        draw a line segment, arc of circle, or simple curve with a virtual pen
        of given width........by sumitra
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Extended color models</h2>
    <p>
      Text, shapes and lines are rendered with a client-specified color. Many
      libraries and cards provide color gradients, which are handy for the
      generation of smoothly-varying backgrounds, shadow effects, etc.. (See
      also Gouraud shading). The pixel colors can also be taken from a texture,
      e.g. a digital image (thus emulating rub-on screentones and the fabled
      "checker paint" which used to be available only in cartoons). Painting a
      pixel with a given color usually replaces its previous color. However,
      many systems support painting with transparent and translucent colors,
      which only modify the previous pixel values. The two colors may also be
      combined in fancier ways, e.g. by computing their bitwise exclusive or.
      This technique is known as inverting color or color inversion, and is
      often used in graphical user interfaces for highlighting, rubber-band
      drawing, and other volatile painting—since re-painting the same shapes
      with the same color will restore the original pixel values
    </p>
    <h2>Layers</h2>
    <p>
      The models used in 2D computer graphics usually do not provide for
      three-dimensional shapes, or three-dimensional optical phenomena such as
      lighting, shadows, reflection, refraction, etc.. However, they usually can
      model multiple layers (conceptually of ink, paper, or film; opaque,
      translucent, or transparent—stacked in a specific order. The ordering is
      usually defined by a single number (the layer's depth, or distance from
      the viewer). Layered models are sometimes called 2 1/2-D computer
      graphics. They make it possible to mimic traditional drafting and printing
      techniques based on film and paper, such as cutting and pasting; and allow
      the user to edit any layer without affecting the others. For these
      reasons, they are used in most graphics editors. Layered models also allow
      better anti-aliasing of complex drawings and provide a sound model for
      certain techniques such as mitered joints and the even-odd rule. Layered
      models are also used to allow the user to suppress unwanted information
      when viewing or printing a document, e.g. roads and/or railways from a
      map, certain process layers from an integrated circuit diagram, or hand
      annotations from a business letter. In a layer-based model, the target
      image is produced by "painting" or "pasting" each layer, in order of
      decreasing depth, on the virtual canvas. Conceptually, each layer is first
      rendered on its own, yielding a digital image with the desired resolution
      which is then painted over the canvas, pixel by pixel. Fully transparent
      parts of a layer need not be rendered, of course. The rendering and
      painting may be done in parallel, i.e. each layer pixel may be painted on
      the canvas as soon as it is produced by the rendering procedure. Layers
      that consist of complex geometric objects (such as text or polylines) may
      be broken down into simpler elements (characters or line segments,
      respectively), which are then painted as separate layers, in some order.
      However, this solution may create undesirable aliasing artifacts wherever
      two elements overlap the same pixel. See also Portable Document
      Format#Layers.

    <h2>2D graphics hardware</h2>
    <p>
      Modern computer graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster
      techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, due to
      the relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with
      vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for
      blitting operations and sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated to
      blitting is known as a Blitter chip. Classic 2D graphics chips of the late
      1970s and early 80s, used in the 8-bit video game consoles and home
      computers, include:
    </p>
    <h2>2D graphics software</h3>
    <p>
      Many graphical user interfaces (GUIs), including Mac OS, Microsoft
      Windows, or the X Window System, are primarily based on 2D graphical
      concepts. Such software provides a visual environment for interacting with
      the computer, and commonly includes some form of window manager to aid the
      user in conceptually distinguishing between different applications. The
      user interface within individual software applications is typically 2D in
      nature as well, due in part to the fact that most common input devices,
      such as the mouse, are constrained to two dimensions of movement. of all
      in irenments.
    </p>
    <p>
      2D graphics are very important in the control peripherals such as
      printers, plotters, sheet cutting machines, etc.. They were also used in
      most early video and computer games; and are still used for card and board
      games such as solitaire, chess, mahjongg, etc..
    </p>
    <p>
      2D graphics editors or drawing programs are application-level software for
      the creation of images, diagrams and illustrations by direct manipulation
      (through the mouse, graphics tablet, or similar device) of 2D computer
      graphics primitives. These editors generally provide geometric primitives
      as well as digital images; and some even support procedural models. The
      illustration is usually represented internally as a layered model, often
      with a hierarchical structure to make editing more convenient. These
      editors generally output graphics files where the layers and primitives
      are separately preserved in their original form. MacDraw, introduced in
      1984 with the Macintosh line of computers, was an early example of this
      class; recent examples are the commercial products Adobe Illustrator and
      CorelDraw, and the free editors such as xfig or Inkscape. There are also
      many 2D graphics editors specialized for certain types of drawings such as
      electrical, electronic and VLSI diagrams, topographic maps, computer
      fonts, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Image editors are specialized for the manipulation of digital images,
      mainly by means of free-hand drawing/painting and signal processing
      operations. They typically use a direct-painting paradigm, where the user
      controls virtual pens, brushes, and other free-hand artistic instruments
      to apply paint to a virtual canvas. Some image editors support a
      multiple-layer model; however, in order to support signal-processing
      operations like blurring each layer is normally represented as a digital
      image. Therefore, any geometric primitives that are provided by the editor
      are immediately converted to pixels and painted onto the canvas. The name
      raster graphics editor is sometimes used to contrast this approach to that
      of general editors which also handle vector graphics. One of the first
      popular image editors was Apple's MacPaint, companion to MacDraw. Modern
      examples are the free GIMP editor, and the commercial products Photoshop
      and Paint Shop Pro. This class too includes many specialized editors — for
      medicine, remote sensing, digital photography, etc.
