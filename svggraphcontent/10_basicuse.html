    <h1>Why computer graphics used?</h1>
    <p>
      Suppose a shoe manufacturing company want to show the sale of shoes for
      five years. For this vast amount of information is to store. So a lot of
      time and memory will be needed. This method will be tough to understand by
      a common man. In this situation graphics is a better alternative. Graphics
      tools are charts and graphs. Using graphs, data can be represented in
      pictorial form. A picture can be understood easily just with a single
      look. Interactive computer graphics work using the concept of two-way
      communication between computer users. The computer will receive signals
      from the input device, and the picture is modified accordingly. Picture
      will be changed quickly when we apply command.

    <h2>Application of Computer Graphics</h2>
    <p>there are many filds where we use computer graphics</p>
    <h4>Education and Training:</h4>
    <p>
      Computer-generated model of the physical, financial and economic system is
      often used as educational aids. Model of physical systems, physiological
      system, population trends or equipment can help trainees to understand the
      operation of the system. For some training applications, particular
      systems are designed. For example Flight Simulator. Flight Simulator: It
      helps in giving training to the pilots of airplanes. These pilots spend
      much of their training not in a real aircraft but on the ground at the
      controls of a Flight Simulator.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fuel Saving</li>
      <li>Safety</li>
      <li>
        Ability to familiarize the training with a large number of the world's
        airports.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Use in Biology:</h3>
    <p>
      Molecular biologist can display a picture of molecules and gain insight
      into their structure with the help of computer graphics.
    </p>
    <h3>Computer-Generated Maps:</h3>
    <p>
      Town planners and transportation engineers can use computer-generated maps
      which display data useful to them in their planning work.
    </p>
    <h3>Architect:</h3>
    <p>
      Architect can explore an alternative solution to design problems at an
      interactive graphics terminal. In this way, they can test many more
      solutions that would not be possible without the computer.
    </p>
    <h3>Presentation Graphics:</h3>
    <p>
      Example of presentation Graphics are bar charts, line graphs, pie charts
      and other displays showing relationships between multiple parameters.
      Presentation Graphics is commonly used to summarize
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial Reports</li>
      <li>Statistical Reports</li>
      <li>Mathematical Reports</li>
      <li>Scientific Reports</li>
      <li>Economic Data for research reports</li>
      <li>Managerial Reports</li>
      <li>Consumer Information Bulletins</li>
      <li>And other types of reports</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Computer Art:</h3>
    <p>
      Computer Graphics are also used in the field of commercial arts. It is
      used to generate television and advertising commercial.
    </p>
    <h3>Entertainment:</h3>
    <p>
      Computer Graphics are now commonly used in making motion pictures, music
      videos and television shows.
    </p>
    <h3>Visualization:</h3>
    <p>
      It is used for visualization of scientists, engineers, medical personnel,
      business analysts for the study of a large amount of information.
    </p>
    <h3>Educational Software:</h3>
    <p>
      Computer Graphics is used in the development of educational software for
      making computer-aided instruction.
    </p>
    <h3>Printing Technology:</h3>
    <p>Computer Graphics is used for printing technology and textile design.</p>
