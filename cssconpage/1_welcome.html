    <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a stylesheet language used to
      describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including
      XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
      should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized
      across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in
      levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now
      split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15%;">
      <img src="./imagess/welcome1.jpg" alt="Welcome" />
    </div>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      <img
        style="float:right;"
        src="./imagess/170px-Håkon_Wium_Lie.jpg"
        alt="History"
        width="140px"
      />
      CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time,
      Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet
      languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions
      on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in
      the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In
      particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of
      CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of
      Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was
      developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web
      style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources
      on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI
      were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be
      influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic
      capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave
      the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more
      complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW
      and WorldWideWeb,[26] made consistent site appearance difficult, and users
      had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor
      developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into
      the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents
      on the web.[27] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the
      structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could
      describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations,
      and editors.[26]
    </p>
    <p>
      Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in
      the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed
      on the www-style mailing list.[25] Of these nine proposals, two were
      especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[21]
      and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[24][28] Two browsers served
      as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to
      implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[29][30][31] Bert Bos
      implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[24] Thereafter, Lie
      and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed
      from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other
      markup languages besides HTML).[22]

      Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one
      group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was
      split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by Dan
      Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad;
      and CSS Working group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed
      with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4,
      1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level
      3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for
      standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like
      CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate
      Recommendation to Working Draft level.
