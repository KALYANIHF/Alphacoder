    <h1>The Basics of Graphic Design: The Elements</h1>
    <p>
      There are in total six elements of a design which you need to be aware of:
      the line, the shape, the color, the texture, the value and the space.
    </p>
    <h2><li>The line</li></h2>
    <p>
      The line is usually present in every design, even if it is a solid border
      of 1px or a dotted one of 5px. Every website has lines, but the
      minimalistic style which became more popular in the past couple of years
      tries to erase the lines from the layouts, or at least to decrease the use
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines can be long, red, straight, thin, blue, dashed, short, black or
      curved, they are all into the same category. They are most of the time
      used for delimitation between different sections of a design, or are used
      to direct a viewer’s vision in a specific direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines can create different effects and visual impact. While a thick,
      bold line draws attention because of its visual power, the thin lines tend
      to go the other way. The color has an impact too, dark colors are easier
      to see and draw more attention than light or pale colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is not all. The style of a line can also influence the way the
      user sees it. This style can easily be defined through CSS and can be
      solid, dotted and dashed among others. The solid lines have a different
      impact than the dotted ones, because they are more imposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimalistic style which I’ve talked about earlier uses either less
      solid lines or more curved lines, because they give a dynamic and fluid
      look to a design, which is also the purpose of the style. They indicate
      energy, keep the user interested and, if combined with illustration, are
      very powerful to the human eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago solid lines were very popular because they determined the
      style of the design: rigid, solid and organized. The web changed in the
      past years and this style is not very popular anymore, especially for
      designers’ portfolios and other pages with a strong need of a personal
      touch.

    <h2><li>The shape</li></h2>
    <p>
      The shape, or the form, is the second most used element of a web design.
      They are actually lines combined in different shapes. The forms are still
      popular and this is because if there is something that needs to stand out,
      forms are one of the ways to do it. There can be circles, squares,
      rectangles, triangles or any other abstract shape; most of the designs
      include at least one of these. Minimalistic designs use it a lot, because
      they are often based on illustrations and drawings. The old style of
      designing websites included shapes too, so they remained popular
      throughout the time and will probably continue being like that. Like
      lines, shapes are also associated by the human mind with different
      movements. For example, circles are associated with movement and nature,
      while squares are often seen as structured, basic designs. Just like with
      the lines, the color, style, background or texture of a shape can totally
      change the viewer’s perception.
    </p>

    <h2><li>Textures</li></h2>
    <p>
      The textures were not very popular a couple of years ago, but they tend to
      become more and more used. They replaced (or compete with, if we can call
      it a competition) the single-colored backgrounds. Textures can look
      similar to solid background colors, but if they are analyzed closer, small
      but effective differences can be noticed. Texture styles include paper,
      stone, concrete, brick, fabric and natural elements, among flat or smooth
      colors. Textures can also be subtle or pronounced and can be used
      sparingly or liberally. They work with pretty much everything. Even if
      they do not seem important, the textures can totally change a website and
      offer a totally different visual impact.
    </p>

    <h2><li>Color</li></h2>
    <p>
      The color may even be the most important element of a design, because it
      offers the most powerful visual impact at a single glance. Color is
      obvious and does not need basic graphic skills to be noticed. While lines
      and shapes mean the same thing as in the reality, only at a little more
      profound level, the color means exactly the same thing as in the nature.
      Color creates emotions – red is passionate, blue is calm, green is
      natural. Even if you don’t realize this, colors have a clear effect on
      your mind. Studies have been done and a person who lives in a red
      environment has a higher heartbeat and pulse than a person living in a
      blue environment. The human brain sees this and influences the rest of the
      body. Therefore color theory is very important to know, because not many
      designers can call themselves experts in this field. Being a master of
      colors might make the difference between a good design and a stunning one.
    </p>

    <h2><li>Value</li></h2>
    <p>
      I did not specify value above, even if it is closely related to color,
      because value is more general and represents how dark or light a design
      is. Value has a lot to do with mood too, only at a more profound level.
      Understanding colors will take you close to perfection, but knowing how
      value works will take you beyond this. Lighter designs offer a different
      impact and feeling than the dark ones and you need an expert eye to notice
      differences and decide which one is the best.
    </p>

    <h2><li>Space</li></h2>
    <p>
      The space and how it is used is crucially important in design. Lately the
      “white space” (also called negative space) became used widely because it
      allows the human eye to read easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      For whoever is not familiar with the term “white space”, it does not mean
      precisely space filled with white, but every area of the design which is
      only filled with the background color. You can see several examples below
      to better understand the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a lot of negative space in your web design, it offers light
      and an open feeling. The lack of white space will turn your design into an
      old-fashioned, cluttered one. The space has also a lot to do with how the
      design is perceived by the human eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if I said the color is maybe the most important element of a design,
      the space is definitely present in the top, because it is also very easy
      to notice by the untrained eye. It can turn a design to your advantage and
      get the best out of your layout.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      These are the basic elements a beginner graphic designer should know
      about. Having this knowledge will allow you to think more user-focused and
      design with a better style. However, this is not everything. Let’s talk
      about design principles.

      The second was about the Principles of Graphic Design and we took a look
      at concepts such as Balance, Dominance, Contrast and Harmony. Today we go
      a bit more in-depth with the last article and talk about the composition
      and its basic elements.
