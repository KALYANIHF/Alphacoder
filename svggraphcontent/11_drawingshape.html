    <h1>Drawing shapes with canvas</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the
      details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will
      have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves,
      providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is
      essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that
      can be done.
    </p>
    <h2>The grid</h2>
    <p>
      Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or
      coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas
      element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this
      canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid
      corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is
      positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are
      placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of
      the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top,
      at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate
      the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but
      for now we'll stick to the default.
    </p>

    <h2>Drawing rectangles</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike SVG, &lt;canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and
      paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be
      created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of
      path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex
      shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw
      rectangles on the canvas:
    </p>
    <div>
      fillRect(x, y, width, height)
    </div>
    <p>Draws a filled rectangle.</p>
    <div>strokeRect(x, y, width, height)</div>
    <p>Draws a rectangular outline.</p>
    <div>clearRect(x, y, width, height)</div>
    <p>
      Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent. Each
      of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the
      position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of
      the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size. Below is the
      draw() function from the previous page, but now it is making use of these
      three functions.
    </p>
    <h2>Rectangular shape example</h2>
    <div>
      <pre>
        function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        
        ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
        ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
        ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
        }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <img src="./images_svg/img11.PNG" alt="" />
    <p>
      The fillRect() function draws a large black square 100 pixels on each
      side. The clearRect() function then erases a 60x60 pixel square from the
      center, and then strokeRect() is called to create a rectangular outline
      50x50 pixels within the cleared square. In upcoming pages we'll see two
      alternative methods for clearRect(), and we'll also see how to change the
      color and stroke style of the rendered shapes. Unlike the path functions
      we'll see in the next section, all three rectangle functions draw
      immediately to the canvas.
    </p>
    <h2>Drawing a triangle</h2>
    <p>
      For example, the code for drawing a triangle would look something like
      this:
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
        function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(75, 50);
        ctx.lineTo(100, 75);
        ctx.lineTo(100, 25);
        ctx.fill();
        }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h3>result will be look like this</h3>
    <img src="./images_svg/img12.PNG" alt="" />
    <h2>Moving the pen</h2>
    <p>
      One very useful function, which doesn't actually draw anything but becomes
      part of the path list described above, is the moveTo() function. You can
      probably best think of this as lifting a pen or pencil from one spot on a
      piece of paper and placing it on the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>moveTo(x, y)</b>
      Moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y. When the canvas is
      initialized or beginPath() is called, you typically will want to use the
      moveTo() function to place the starting point somewhere else. We could
      also use moveTo() to draw unconnected paths. Take a look at the smiley
      face below.
    </p>
    <p>
      To try this for yourself, you can use the code snippet below. Just paste
      it into the draw() function we saw earlier.
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
        function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(75, 75, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Outer circle
        ctx.moveTo(110, 75);
        ctx.arc(75, 75, 35, 0, Math.PI, false); // Mouth (clockwise)
        ctx.moveTo(65, 65);
        ctx.arc(60, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Left eye
        ctx.moveTo(95, 65);
        ctx.arc(90, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Right eye
        ctx.stroke();
        }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
